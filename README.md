In this repository I follow a YouTube playlist "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLO5VPQH6OWdUrKEWPF07CSuVm3T99DQki" by the Smart Contract Programmer YouTube chanle, That went over the Foundry framework with a focus on testing. I would 100% recommend this playlist to anyone looking to learn about testing smart contracts using Foundry.
